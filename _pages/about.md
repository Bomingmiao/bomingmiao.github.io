Hi, I am Boming Miao! I am currently a master student of School of Statistics, Beijing Normal University.
## Education
- M.S. 2023-2025, School of Statistics, Beijing Normal University
- B.S. 2019-2023, Department of Mathematics, Northeastern University

## Research Intersts
- I am deeply interested in developing reliable and trustworthy AI techniques, and particularly adversarial mathine learning. 
- I am also interested in generative models and LLMs, and their novel applications such as adversarial attack.
- It is really cool to explore the explainability and interpretability , and derive the bound given their structures.
- Statistical learning is also in the list and I would like to explore the probablistic generative models.
- I am always interested in unkonwn fields and would like to explore more.

## Recent Work
- **Robust LLMs:** enhancing the robustness of LLMs by exploring both the vulnerability and explainability.
- **OOD Detection (with [Andi Zhang](https://andi.ac/)):** investigating novel methods for calculating in-distribution and out-of-distribution probabilities based on generative models.

## Selected Papaers
- **AdvLogo: Adversarial Patch Attack based on Diffusion Models [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07002) [Code](https://github.com/Bomingmiao/Advlogo)** 
We propose a novel framework of patch attack from semantic perspective. We can utilize diffusion models to generate adversarial logos that can cause the model to fail in recognizing objects.

- **An Efficient Framework for Enhancing Discriminative Models via Diffusion Techniques [under review](https://openreview.net/forum?id=kxKXcFnF37&referrer=%5Bthe%20profile%20of%20Boming%20Miao%5D(%2Fprofile%3Fid%3D~Boming_Miao1))**
Inspired by the coordinated cognitive processes of rapid-slow pathway interactions in the human brain during visual signal recognition, we propose the Diffusion-Based Discriminative Model Enhancement Framework (DBMEF). This framework seamlessly integrates discriminative and generative models in a training-free manner, leveraging discriminative models for initial predictions and endowing deep neural networks with rethinking capabilities via diffusion models.
