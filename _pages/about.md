I am now a master student of School of Statistics, Beijing Normal University.

## Education

- M.S. 2023-2025, School of Statistics, Beijing Normal University
- B.S. 2019-2023, Department of Mathematics, Northeastern University

## Research Interst

- I am deeply interested in developing reliable and trustworthy AI techniques, and particularly adversarial mathine learning. 
- I am also interested in generative models and LLMs, and their novel applications such as adversarial attack.
- It is really cool to explore the explainability and interpretability , and derive the bound given their structures.
- Statistical learning is also in the list and I would like to explore the probablistic generative models.

Recent Work
================
- **AdvLogo: Adversarial Patch Attack based on Diffusion Models [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07002)**  
  We propose a novel framework of patch attack from semantic perspective. We can utilize diffusion models to generate adversarial logos that can cause the model to fail in recognizing objects.
