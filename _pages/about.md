- B.S. 2019-2023, Department of Mathematics, Northeastern University

## Research Interst

I am deeply interested in developing reliable and trustworthy AI techniques, particularly in exploring the distribution of adversarial examples generated by models. My recent work focuses on enhancing the robustness of adversarial patches through the application of diffusion models, a cutting-edge approach that allows for greater flexibility and effectiveness in adversarial attacks. Additionally, I am keenly interested in statistical learning theory and its implications for the capabilities of deep learning models.

In the long term, I aspire to contribute to the development of theory-guided learning. While I recognize that this is a complex endeavor that may not be achievable in the foreseeable future, I firmly believe that advancements in learning theory will unfold gradually, ultimately leading to models whose decisions are both explainable and rational.
